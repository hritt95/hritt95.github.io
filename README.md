<h1> Blossom & Hue Stacking Ring for Women Teens & Girls [18K Gold Plated on .925 Sterling Silver] - Dainty Beaded Band [Hypoallergenic]</h1>

<p>I ordered my first one <i>(size 7)</i> months ago and wore it EVERYDAY ALL DAY. So in the shower, pool, ocean etc. and it lasted pretty well (that’s why I’m still rating this 4 stars). It never turned your finger green or anything but eventually started to show silver instead of gold so I decided to order a new gold size 7 and it was exactly like the first! However, then I decided to order the same in a size 6 for my thumb and it came VERY yellow almost orange in color.. looked very fake and tacky, so I reordered a new size 6 and it’s the same! Orangey yellow! Will be returning those.. so i don’t know what to think.. if you’re a size 7 they seem to come in a more natural yellow gold tone but the size 6 id stay away from especially if you have other gold jewelry on to see the difference!

<p>I love this ring!! I’ve had it for about a month and wear it in the shower, pool, and at work where I’m washing my hands constantly and it hasn’t turned green. I loved the ring because of the style of course, but I am pleasantly <i>surprised at how it’s held up!</i> </P>

<p>I liked the ring but I was hoping it would be a bit wider . <i>It is very thin</i>. Good quality for the money .</p>

<p>nice quality ring, but it <i>doesn't look like the picture in the description.</i> I do not like the look of it if it wasn't stacked with another ring.</p>
